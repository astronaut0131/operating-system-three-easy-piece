/*
	strdup -- allocates and duplicates a string
	about execl(), execle(), execlp(), execv(), execvp(), and execvP():

	The base of each is exec (execute), followed by one or more letters:

	e – An array of pointers to environment variables is explicitly passed to the new process image.
	l – Command-line arguments are passed individually (a list) to the function.
	p – Uses the PATH environment variable to find the file named in the file argument to be executed.
	v – Command-line arguments are passed to the function as an array (vector) of pointers.
